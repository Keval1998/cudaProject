We will need a image file for testing a code.In google colab google drive can be mounted to use directory structure.A Sample
image is given with this project.
	code for that:
		from google.colab import drive
		drive.mount('/content/drive')
		
File1: ConvertToGreyScale.txt
	This file is reading a image from given example path and converting it to grey scale.
	The small portion is taken as separet file so that we can check the grey scale image conversion.
	
File2: imageToVector.txt
	This file reads our grey scale image on which we are going to apply equalization.and creatres another text
file as an output for the input of our algorithm.
	And This file also shows Histogrm of an original image that is grey scaled.
	Sometimes if runtime enviornment has overhead issues ,specially in case of google colab, so just we need to check 
numbers of digits or lines in output text files are completelly written by file pointer

File3a: ParallelEqualization.txt
	This file is applying equalization algorithm on vector which we have got from the File2.
	This is parallel approach which uses Shared memory in computations to increase CGMA ratio.another approach using 
global memory is demonstrated in module/Shared-Global.txt file.
	In this files Extra functions are implemented such that anyone can debug intemediate results.

File3b: SerialEqualization.txt
	This file is doing same task as  File3a. but it will be serial calculations.
	
File4: ImageSave.txt
	This file generates an image that is equalized and it also plots equalized histogram to verification of equalization
on a image histogram.
	Output image can be verified after save.
